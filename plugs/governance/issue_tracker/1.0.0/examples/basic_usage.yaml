# Basic Issue Tracker Usage Examples
# ===================================

# Example 1: Simple local storage (development)
local_storage:
  operation: store_issues
  storage_backend: local_file
  storage_config:
    local_file:
      storage_path: "validation_issues.json"
      backup_enabled: true
      max_history: 50
  issues:
    validation_run_id: "dev_test_001"
    timestamp: "2025-08-29T14:30:00Z"
    target_plugin: "test_plugin"
    change_type: "created"
    pipeline_score: 90
    issues_list:
      - category: "code_quality"
        severity: "low"
        description: "Minor formatting issue"
        file_path: "test_plugin/main.py"
        recommendation: "Run code formatter"

# Example 2: Auto-selection with fallback
auto_with_fallback:
  operation: store_issues
  storage_backend: auto
  storage_config:
    sqlite:
      database_path: "issues.db"
      table_name: "validation_issues"
    local_file:
      storage_path: "backup_issues.json"
      max_history: 25
  issues:
    validation_run_id: "auto_test_001" 
    timestamp: "2025-08-29T14:35:00Z"
    target_plugin: "security_plugin"
    change_type: "modified"
    pipeline_score: 75
    issues_list:
      - category: "security"
        severity: "high"
        description: "Hardcoded credentials detected"
        file_path: "security_plugin/config.py"
